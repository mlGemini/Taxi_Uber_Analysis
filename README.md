# Taxi_Uber_Analysis
UNI: ml4818、sl5197
## 1. Introduction

This project uses Python and SQL queries to answer particular questions by downloading and cleaning data, storing the data in a SQLite database, and providing analysis and visualizations, using hired-ride trip data from Uber and NYC Yellow cab from January 2009 through June 2015, and joining with local historical weather data.

### 1.1 Dataset Introduction
1) Uber rides: a sample of Uber rides from 01-2009 through 06-2015 can be downloaded from [Uber_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F7D82w1D5151GXCR6BTEk7mNQ_YnPNDk/view).

2) Yellow Taxi trip data: Use [Taxi_link](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) to download the Parquet files.
3) Historical weather data: the complete catalog of local climatological data for 2009 through 2015 [Weather_link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1I_Cj3RFHRGcQjb5Gas06buqRbKodIwKC), plus the dataset’s documentation, can be found in this folder [Weather_document](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1I_Cj3RFHRGcQjb5Gas06buqRbKodIwKC).

### 1.2 Installation
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
```conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg```
### 1.3 Group work
Meng Li(ml4818) is responsible for preprocessing Taxi and Uber data and Part4 (Visulization);
Shangxian Liu(sl5197) is is responsible for preprocessing Weather data and Part3 (SQL Analysis).
Equal work contribution.

## 2. Result
We have already completed Data cleaning, storing, 6 questions in Part3 and 6 questions in Part4.

Besides, **the Test requirement, Sunrise-Sunset table and Animation are also finished**.

## 3. Code
The specific process can be seen in Project.ipynb file.
